At rOpenSci we are creating packages that allow access to data repositories through the R statistical
programming environment that is already a familiar part of the workflow of many scientists. Our tools 
not only facilitate drawing data into an environment where it can readily be manipulated, but also one 
in which those analyses
and methods can be easily shared, replicated, and extended by other researchers.
