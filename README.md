# DataandTools
A list of data and tools that I find while browsing the web

## ropensci.org

http://ropensci.org/

At rOpenSci we are creating packages that allow access to data repositories through the R statistical
programming environment that is already a familiar part of the workflow of many scientists. Our tools 
not only facilitate drawing data into an environment where it can readily be manipulated, but also one 
in which those analyses
and methods can be easily shared, replicated, and extended by other researchers.


## Prophet

https://facebookincubator.github.io/prophet/

Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data. It is based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly and weekly seasonality, plus holidays. It works best with daily periodicity data with at least one year of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data, shifts in the trend, and large outliers.
